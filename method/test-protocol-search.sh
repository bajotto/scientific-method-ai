## 1. Testable hypotheses

### H1: no duplicate sends
- **H0 (null):** the system can send the same message twice
- **H1 (alternative):** every recipient gets at most one message
- **Acceptance criterion:** 0 duplicate sends across 100% of history
- **Status:** ✅ validated (12/12, 2026-08-01)

### H2: no broken placeholders
- **H0 (null):** rendered messages contain an unresolved placeholder
- **H1 (alternative):** 100% of messages render clean
- **Acceptance criterion:** 0 occurrences of `{{` in sent output
- **Status:** ⏳ not yet tested

## 2. Phases

### Phase 1 — Discovery
**Goal:** understand current state, no execution.
**Status:** complete, 2026-07-20
**Findings:** 340 candidate recipients, 12 flagged as duplicates upstream.

### Phase 2 — Pilot
**Goal:** validate hypotheses against 3-5 real cases.
**Status:** complete, 2026-08-01
**Result:** 12/12 pass
**Approval to scale:** granted, pedro, 2026-08-02

## 3. Incident log

### Incident: 2026-08-15
**What happened:** two messages sent to the same recipient within 4 seconds.
**Root cause:** retry logic did not check a send-in-flight marker.

### Incident: 2026-09-01
**What happened:** a template rendered with a literal `{{name}}` placeholder.
**Root cause:** the render step was skipped for one message class.
